nucleicAcidBackboneTubesSticks            This code shows the cartoon backbone tube as 65% transparent. It hides the rungs of the cartoon. It shows all of the non-H atoms are sticks. The motivation is to have the cartoon highlight the backbone without dominanting the scene.
nucleicAcidCartoon                        Settings for nucliec acid cartoon. The dark blue used for electron density maps is called `density`. The cartoon_ladder_radius should be renamed the cartoon_rung_radius. The dimensions are in Angstroms.
nucleicAcidCartoon2Strands                Coloring two strand differently of a double helix makes it easier to for the viewer to distinguish the two strands. The set command has the syntax of setting_name [, setting_value [, selection [,state ]]] . In this case, the selection has to be global, object, object-state, or per-atom settings. It cannot be a named selection. This is a weak spot in PyMOL. Coloring two strand differently of a double helix makes it easier to for the viewer to distinguish the two strands. Many double-stranded helices have one strand in the asymmetric unit. The second strand is in the biological unit. The coordinates for the second strand are in the pdb1 file type at the PDB. The second strand is in the second state, which is equivalent to the second model in the pdb file. The strands are labeled chain A and B (via the cartoon_nucliec_acid_color setting). The bases are colored differently too (via the cartoon_ladder_color setting).
nucleicAcidCartoonFilledRings             The code provides a cartoon of the loaded nucleic acid that has the ladder rungs replaced by filled rings that are colored by atom type. The code can be applied to any nucleic acid. It is derived from the FR shortuct in pymolshortcuts.py.
